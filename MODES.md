# üîÆ Seven Seals Framework - Invocation Modes

The Seven Seals Framework offers three modes of operation, each suited for different types of work. Choose the mode that matches your project's scope and complexity.

## üöÄ Quick Mode
**When to use:** Bug fixes, small improvements, hotfixes, minor refactoring

**Seals to invoke:**
1. **The Lamb** - Creates Tech Spec
2. **Fourth Seal (Pale Horse - Backend)** - Implements the fix
3. **Seventh Seal (Silence - QA)** - Tests and validates

**Command sequence:**
```bash
# 1. Create the Tech Spec
claude --agent 01_the-lamb-lead-architect.md "Create Tech Spec for [describe bug/improvement]"

# 2. Implement the solution
claude --agent 05_fourth-seal-pale-horse-backend.md "Implement the fix based on Tech Spec"

# 3. Test and validate
claude --agent 08_seventh-seal-silence-qa.md "Test the implementation"
```

**Time estimate:** 1-4 hours
**Complexity:** Low
**Risk:** Minimal

## üìã Standard Mode
**When to use:** New features, significant enhancements, API additions, UI components

**Seals to invoke:**
1. **The Lamb** - Creates Tech Spec or Feature Spec
2. **Second Seal (Red Horse - Data)** - Designs data contracts and schemas
3. **Third Seal (Black Horse - Frontend)** - Builds UI components
4. **Fourth Seal (Pale Horse - Backend)** - Implements backend logic
5. **Seventh Seal (Silence - QA)** - Comprehensive testing

**Command sequence:**
```bash
# 1. Create the specification
claude --agent 01_the-lamb-lead-architect.md "Create Tech Spec for [feature name]"

# 2. Design data layer
claude --agent 03_second-seal-red-horse-data.md "Design data contracts and schemas"

# 3. Build frontend (if needed)
claude --agent 04_third-seal-black-horse-frontend.md "Implement UI components"

# 4. Implement backend
claude --agent 05_fourth-seal-pale-horse-backend.md "Implement backend services"

# 5. Test everything
claude --agent 08_seventh-seal-silence-qa.md "Run comprehensive tests"
```

**Time estimate:** 1-5 days
**Complexity:** Medium
**Risk:** Moderate

---

## ‚öîÔ∏è Full Mode
**When to use:** New projects, major refactoring, system redesigns, microservices

**Seals to invoke:** All seals as needed

**Command sequence:**
```bash
# 1. Create Project Blueprint
claude --agent 01_the-lamb-lead-architect.md "Create Project Blueprint for [project name]"

# 2. UI/UX Design
claude --agent 02_first-seal-white-horse-uiux.md "Design user experience and interface"

# 3. Data Architecture
claude --agent 03_second-seal-red-horse-data.md "Design complete data architecture"

# 4. Frontend Implementation
claude --agent 04_third-seal-black-horse-frontend.md "Build frontend application"

# 5. Backend Implementation
claude --agent 05_fourth-seal-pale-horse-backend.md "Implement backend services"

# 6. AI/ML Features (if applicable)
claude --agent 06_fifth-seal-martyrs-aiml.md "Implement AI/ML capabilities"

# 7. Platform & Infrastructure
claude --agent 07_sixth-seal-cosmic-upheaval-platform.md "Setup infrastructure and deployment"

# 8. Quality Assurance
claude --agent 08_seventh-seal-silence-qa.md "Complete testing and chaos engineering"

# 9. Final Review
claude --agent 09_great-white-throne-tda.md "Final technical review and approval"
```

**Time estimate:** 1-4 weeks
**Complexity:** High
**Risk:** Significant

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **When in doubt, start smaller** - You can always escalate from Quick to Standard mode
2. **Use Quick Mode for urgent fixes** - Get to production faster
3. **Use Standard Mode for planned work** - Balance speed and thoroughness
4. **Use Full Mode for greenfield projects** - Start with proper foundation
5. **The Lamb will help you decide** - If unsure, the Lead Architect agent will ask which mode to use

## üîÑ Mode Escalation

You can escalate between modes if scope increases:

```
Quick Mode ‚Üí Standard Mode: Add data and frontend seals
Standard Mode ‚Üí Full Mode: Add remaining seals for complete coverage
```

Remember: The mode is a guideline, not a rigid rule. Adapt based on your specific needs.
