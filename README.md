# The Four-ish Agentic Horsemen Development Team

A powerful 6-agent structure combining the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse with Master of Puppets orchestration and Hades' final judgment.

## Agent Structure

### 00 - Master of Puppets (Lead Architect)

**The Orchestrator**

* Plans and architects everything  
* Creates comprehensive context  
* Orchestrates the workflow  
* **Model**: Opus (complex planning)

### 01 - Conquest (Full-Spectrum Engineer)

**The Builder**

* Conquers the entire stack (Frontend + Backend + Database)  
* Integrates AI/ML capabilities  
* Connects external services  
* **Model**: Sonnet (implementation)

### 02 - War (Site Reliability Engineer — SRE)

**The Operations Commander**

* Deploys and manages infrastructure  
* Security and compliance  
* Monitoring and observability  
* **Model**: Sonnet (operations)

### 03 - Famine (Systems Performance Engineer)

**The Optimizer**

* Performance optimization  
* Resource efficiency  
* Cost reduction  
* Technical debt elimination  
* **Model**: Sonnet (optimization)

### 04 - Death (Software Development Engineer in Test — SDET)

**The Quality Guardian**

* Comprehensive testing  
* Bug extermination  
* Security auditing  
* Performance validation  
* **Model**: Sonnet (quality assurance)

### 05 - Hades (Technical Design Authority Architect — TDA)

**The Final Judge**

* Code review and validation  
* Ensures plan execution  
* Creates documentation  
* Final approval before production  
* **Model**: Opus (final review)

## Execution Flow

```
0. Master of Puppets → Plans the entire project
   ↓
1. Conquest → Builds the complete feature
   ↓
2. War → Deploys and secures
   ↓
3. Famine → Optimizes performance
   ↓
4. Death → Tests and validates
   ↓
5. Hades → Reviews and documents
```

## Why This Structure Works

### Thematic Coherence

Each agent owns a complete domain:

* **Creation** (Conquest)  
* **Operations** (War)  
* **Efficiency** (Famine)  
* **Quality** (Death)  
* **Vision** (Master of Puppets)  
* **Final Judgment** (Hades)  

### Minimal Context Switching

Only 6 agents means fewer handoffs and clearer responsibilities.

### Natural Workflow

Follows actual development flow: Plan → Build → Deploy → Optimize → Test → Review

### Context Engineering
